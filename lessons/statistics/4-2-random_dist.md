[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

## QUESTION
The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.
Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?

## SOLUTION
#### Generate 1000 random numbers
```python
random_array = np.random.random(1000)
```

#### Plot PMF& CDF
```python
random_pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(random_array)
random_cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(random_array)

thinkplot.Pmf(random_pmf,  linewidth=0.2)
thinkplot.Show(xlabel='value', ylabel='PMF')

thinkplot.Cdf(random_cdf)
thinkplot.Show(xlabel='value', ylabel='CDF')
```

#### Is it actually uniform?
Yes, at least very close to uniform. The pdf has a value of 1/1000, almost perfectly evenly distributed between 0 and 1. The cdf is almost a straight line
